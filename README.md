A Packrat parser shares many similarities with a recursive descent parser but uses PEG (Parsing Expression Grammar) instead of LL Grammars.

This implementation has several tools and features that can be used in your applications. Please refer to [Our Wiki](https://github.com/blitzmaxmods/packrat.mod/wiki) for installation, usage and other documentation.
