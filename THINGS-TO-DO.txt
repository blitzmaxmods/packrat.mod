*. Fix PEG() so it produces decent results -   DONE
*. Fix LINE and BLOCK comments

* Replace escape() and deescape() in parser.bmx
    - Move them into TPattern as encode() and decode() so they can be over-ridden if necessary
    - Standardise on escape symbols instead of /xNNN or /UNNN
        - What does ABNF use for unicode? %XXXX or &NNN; etc...

* Current way of catching an error
    LINE -> _* ( EOL / RULE / COMMENT / BADLINE ) 
    BADLINE -> ( !EOL . )* EOL

    - Implement labels
    - Return label == null, we backtrack with nothing found
    - Return label == nonterminal (rule) we execute that rule to clean up
    - Return label == missing non-terminal, Produce "Unexpected symbols at"

    LINE <- SP EOL / RULE / SOMETHING^recovery
    recovery <- (!EOL . )* EOL 

    Improve LABELs

    A label is currently processed by the patternm but it should not.
    A Lbal is nothign more than a non terminal that is used like choice

    myrule^label is the same as ( myrule | label )

    So in TPattern.fail(), you should simply: Return New TNonTerminal( label )
    if label is set and result.node = null

* Add support For directives in PEG file:
! KEY = VALUE

    Current directives:
    !START=Blitzmax
    !RESERVEDWORDS=	' Used to prevent keywords from being reserved words

* Strings:

    String = '"' value:(!(eol / '"') .)+ '"' { return value; }
           / '"' value:(!(eol / '"') .)+     { error('unterminated string constant'); return value; }

* "EXPECTED" ERROR MESSAGES

        number -> [0-9]*
        sum => number "+" number

    grammar.parse( "3 + A" )    "Expected 'number' at 5"

        number "integer" -> [0-9]*
        sum => number "+" number

    grammar.parse( "3 + A" )    "Expected 'integer' at 5"

POST IMPLEMENTATION CLEANUP
* Review "kind" in TParseNode.new() - Do we still need it?
* Review "depth" in TPattern.getMatch() and Matcher() - Do we still need them?
