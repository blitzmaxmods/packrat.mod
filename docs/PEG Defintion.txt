Blizmax PEG Definition

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar

1. Introduction

A PEG file is a set of lines that define grammar rules and can include blank lines and comments.

A line can be terminated by CR (ASCII=13) or CRLF (ASCII=13,ASCII=10).

2. Comments
Any line that starts with the Hash symbol (ASCII=35,"#") is a comment and is ignored for the purposes of the PEG defintion.

3. Rule Defintion

A Rule defintion contains a head and a body seperated by the literal "<-".
The head is a non-terminal identifier that acts as the rule name.
The body is an expression that defines the rule.

    <head> <- <body>

3.1. Rule name (head)

A Rule name is case insensitive and can only contain the characters A-Z and a-z only.

It is defined as:

    RULENAME <- [A-Za-z]

3.2. Rule defintion (body)

4. Symbols

The following symbols are used in the defintion of a PEG grammar:

    #   COMMENT
    <-  ASSIGNMENT
    *   Zero or more
    +   One or more
    ?   OPTIONAL (Zero or One)
    &   AND
    !   NEGATED
    []  RANGE
    ()  GROUP
    /   OPTION
    @   Search
    ~   Case insensitive
    %   Character Encoding
    ;   Character Encoding
    ^   Defines a label (used by error recovery)
    $   Defined a capture

5. Expressions

    SEQUENCE            E1 E2 E3
    ORDERED CHOICE      E1 / E2 / E3
    ZERO-OR-MORE        E*
    ONE-OR-MORE         E+
    OPTIONAL            E?
    AND-PREDICATE       &E
    NOT-PREDICATE       !E
    GROUP               (E)
    TERMINAL            Quoted String
    SEARCH              @E              Same as <- (!E .)* E
    NON-TERMINAL        String

    LABEL               E^label
    CAPTURE             $E

6. LITERALS
Any string enclosed in quotes is matched explicitly and is case sensitive by default.
A case insensitive string can be declared by adding a "i" suffix:

For example:
    "Case Sensitive"        Matches "Case Sensitive", but not "CASE SENSITIVE"
    "Case Insensitive"i     Matches "Case Insensitive" and "CASE INSENSITIVE"
